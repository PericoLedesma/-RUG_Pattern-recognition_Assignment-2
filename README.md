# Creating Pattern Recognition Pipelines using Traditional Machine Learning methods

This project is the result of a project for the course Pattern Recognition of the RuG Msc program.
We create two pipelines using two different datasets using traditional machine learning methods.
1. The first pipeline classifies images from the BigCats datasets.
2. The second pipeline classifies different kinds of tumors using genetic codes.

We refer the user to the two separate folders in the repository which contains README files for run instructions.
The folder Task 1_Images pipeline contain the files for the image classification pipeline.
The folder Task 1_Numeric pipeline contains the filer for the genetic pipeline.

A more detailed explanation about the pipelines can be found in our paper which can be found in this repository.
