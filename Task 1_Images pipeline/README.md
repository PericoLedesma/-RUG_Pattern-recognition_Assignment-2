#Image classification pipeline
This project creates a pipeline that aims to classify animals from the BigCats dataset.
We provide the BigCats dataset as well as the BigCats_Better dataset which is an improved version of the dataset as .zip files. See the paper of this project for a detailed information about the difference between BigCats and BigCats_Better. We also refer the reader to the paper for specific details about the pipeline.

#How to run the code?

1. Create a folder called 'data' and unzip the BigCats_Better.zip file in here.
2. Install the requirements with pip install -r requirements.txt
