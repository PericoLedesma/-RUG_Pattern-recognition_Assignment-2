#Image classification pipeline
This project creates a pipeline that aims to classify animals from the BigCats dataset.
We provide the BigCats dataset as well as the BigCats_Better dataset which is an improved version of the dataset as .zip files. See the paper of this project for a detailed information about the difference between BigCats and BigCats_Better. We also refer the reader to the paper for specific details about the pipeline.

#How to run the code?

Use the following commands to run the pipeline
1. unzip BigCats_better.zip
2. pip install -r requirements.txt
3. python3 main.py

The run instructions were tested on both MacOS and Linux using Python 3.8.8

Please note that running the entire pipeline can take up to 15 minutes depending on the performance of the computer that it is ran on.
